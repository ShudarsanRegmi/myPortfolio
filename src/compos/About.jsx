                Namasteüôè! I'm Shudarsan Regmi, a web developer with a focus on full-stack development and a passion for security. I work with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS, PHP, and databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite3.
                Proficient in C and Python, I enjoy automating tasks using python and reading code in various languages. I actively explore web security through penetration testing on platforms like DVWA, PortSwigger, TryHackMe, and HackTheBox.
                I prefer delving into low-level tasks rather than navigating through numerous layers of abstraction where the underlying processes are not entirely clear to me.
